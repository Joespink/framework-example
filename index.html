<p>Speaking about the band's name, the drummer Jimmi Naylor said: "I never liked the name at first. But it's stuck– and it's probably got us more attention having a silly name. The band were just discussing band names and he came up with 'The Pigeon Detectives'. It became an in-joke but we thought nothing of it. But when it came to our first gig in Leeds the promoter was saying, 'What's your name?' We were like 'Oh, um... "The Pigeon Detectives".'"
When asked by BBC Sound about the name, Naylor said, "Dave breeds pigeons, and there's a pigeon that lives in a shed, thats his special pigeon, and this pigeon actually writes all the songs".[6] Another story about the band's name was proposed when Matt Bowman and Ryan Wilson were interviewed for Later with Jools Holland; Bowman said that he and Wilson have a tradition of having Christmas dinner together and when they pulled the cracker they found the name in there. When asked about the Leeds Festival rumour Bowman denies it and said, "There's also a rumour that there's a giant pigeon at the bottom of our garden that writes all the lyrics, but that's equally as untrue."
